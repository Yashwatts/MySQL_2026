## 1. SQL JOIN Types

- Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

| Join Type | Description |
|---|---|
| INNER JOIN | Returns records that have matching values in both tables. |
| LEFT JOIN | Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right. |
| RIGHT JOIN | Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left. |
| FULL JOIN | Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. |
| CROSS JOIN | Returns the Cartesian product (every possible combination) of both tables. |
| SELF JOIN | A regular join where a table is joined with itself. |


## 2. Deep Dive: Key Concepts

### Inner Join & Filtering

- Basic Syntax:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
JOIN_TYPE table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- Efficiency: Filtering AND withing the ON clause is often more efficient than using a WHERE clause because it filters data during the join process rather that after.
- An INNER JOIN returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables based on the specified join condition.
- If there's no match, the rows from both tables are excluded from the result set.

```sql
-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE db_inner_join;
USE db_inner_join;

-- Create authors table
CREATE TABLE authors (
    author_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    birth_year INT
);

-- Create books table
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    author_id INT,
    publication_year INT,
    price DECIMAL(6,2)
);

-- Insert data into authors table
INSERT INTO authors (author_id, first_name, last_name, birth_year)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Jane', 'Austen', 1775),
    (2, 'George', 'Orwell', 1903),
    (3, 'Ernest', 'Hemingway', 1899),
    (4, 'Agatha', 'Christie', 1890),
    (5, 'J.K.', 'Rowling', 1965);

-- Insert data into books table
INSERT INTO books (book_id, title, author_id, publication_year, price)
VALUES 
    (101, 'Pride and Prejudice', 1, 1813, 12.99),
    (102, '1984', 2, 1949, 14.50),
    (103, 'Animal Farm', 2, 1945, 11.75),
    (104, 'The Old Man and the Sea', 3, 1952, 10.99),
    (105, 'Murder on the Orient Express', 4, 1934, 13.25),
    (106, 'Death on the Nile', 4, 1937, 12.50),
    (107, 'Emma', 1, 1815, 11.99),
    (108, 'For Whom the Bell Tolls', 3, 1940, 15.75);

-- Display table contents
SELECT * FROM authors;
SELECT * FROM books;

-- Retrieve books with their author's information with conditions and ordering
SELECT b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name, a.birth_year
FROM books AS b
INNER JOIN authors AS a
ON a.author_id = b.author_id
WHERE b.publication_year > 1940
ORDER BY birth_year;

-- Count how many books each author has written
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name, COUNT(*) AS book_count
FROM authors AS a
JOIN books AS b
ON a.author_id = b.author_id;
GROUP BY a.author_id;


-- Create categories table for many-to-many relationship example
CREATE TABLE categories (
    category_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO categories (category_id, category_name)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Fiction'),
    (2, 'Classic'),
    (3, 'Romance'),
    (4, 'Political'),
    (5, 'Mystery'),
    (6, 'Adventure');

-- Create junction table for book-category many-to-many relationship
CREATE TABLE book_categories (
    book_id INT,
    category_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (book_id, category_id)
);

INSERT INTO book_categories (book_id, category_id)
VALUES 
    (101, 1), (101, 2), (101, 3), -- Pride and Prejudice: Fiction, Classic, Romance
    (102, 1), (102, 2), (102, 4), -- 1984: Fiction, Classic, Political
    (103, 1), (103, 2), (103, 4), -- Animal Farm: Fiction, Classic, Political
    (104, 1), (104, 2), (104, 6), -- The Old Man and the Sea: Fiction, Classic, Adventure
    (105, 1), (105, 5), -- Murder on the Orient Express: Fiction, Mystery
    (106, 1), (106, 5), -- Death on the Nile: Fiction, Mystery
    (107, 1), (107, 2), (107, 3), -- Emma: Fiction, Classic, Romance
    (108, 1), (108, 2), (108, 6); -- For Whom the Bell Tolls: Fiction, Classic, Adventure

-- Get books with their authors and categories using GROUP_CONCAT
SELECT b.title, a.first_name, a.last_name, GROUP_CONCAT(c.category_name SEPARATOR ', ') AS categories
FROM books b
JOIN authors a
ON b.author_id = a.author_id
JOIN book_categories AS bc
ON b.book_id = bc.book_id
JOIN categories c
ON bc.category_id = c.category_id
GROUP BY b.book_id;

-- Example with join condition in ON clause (Return books published before 1950 by authors born before 1900)
SELECT b.title, a.last_name
FROM books b
INNER JOIN authors a
ON b.author_id = a.author_id AND b.publication_year < 1950 AND a.birth_year < 1900;

-- Equivalent example with join condition in WHERE clause
SELECT b.title, a.last_name
FROM books b
INNER JOIN authors a ON b.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE b.publication_year < 1950 
  AND a.birth_year < 1900;
-- But using filtering at time of Joining is more efficient

-- Example with date functions - books published more than 70 years ago
SELECT b.title, a.last_name
FROM books b
INNER JOIN authors a
ON b.author_id = a.author_id
WHERE YEAR(CURDATE()) - b.publication_year > 70;
```


- Note: INNER JOIN excludes rows with NULL values in the join columns. If you want to include rows with NULL values, you would need to use LEFT JOIN or RIGHT JOIN.
- Find authors who have written more than one book using HAVING clause:

```sql
SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name, COUNT(b.book_id) AS book_count
FROM authors a
INNER JOIN books b
ON a.author_id = b.author_id
GROUP BY a.author_id, a.first_name, a.last_name
HAVING COUNT(b.book_id) > 1;
```


### Left & Right Joins (Outer Joins)

- Used when you need to keep all records from one "primary" table, even if there's no corresponding data in the "secondary" table.

- Handling Nulls: If no match exists, the result will contain NULL for the missing side.

- Pro Tip: Use the IFNULL() function to replace NULL results with a default value (like 0) for cleaner reporting.
- It returns ALL records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table.
- If no match exists in the right table, NULL values will be returned for the right table's columns.

- Basic LEFT JOIN syntax:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.column = table2.column;
```

- Create and set up database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE left_join;
USE left_join;

-- Create customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Create orders table with foreign key
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

-- Insert sample customer data
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, customer_name, email, city)
VALUES 
    (1, 'John Smith', 'john@example.com', 'New York'),
    (2, 'Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com', 'Los Angeles'),
    (3, 'Robert Johnson', 'robert@example.com', 'Chicago'),
    (4, 'Emily Davis', 'emily@example.com', 'Houston'),
    (5, 'Michael Brown', 'michael@example.com', 'Phoenix');

-- Insert sample order data
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
VALUES 
    (101, 1, '2023-01-15', 150.75),
    (102, 3, '2023-01-16', 89.50),
    (103, 1, '2023-01-20', 45.25),
    (104, 2, '2023-01-25', 210.30),
    (105, 3, '2023-02-01', 75.00);


-- Example 1: Basic LEFT JOIN
-- Get all customers and their orders (if any)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;

-- Example 2: Finding customers with no orders
-- Note the use of IS NULL in the WHERE clause
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_id IS NULL;

-- Example 3: Using aggregate functions with LEFT JOIN
-- Get customer order counts and total spending
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, COUNT(o.order_id) AS order_count, IFNULL(SUM(o.total_amount), 0) AS total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id;


-- Create shipping table for multiple joins example
CREATE TABLE shipping (
    shipping_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    shipping_date DATE,
    carrier VARCHAR(50),
    tracking_number VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
);

-- Insert sample shipping data
INSERT INTO shipping (shipping_id, order_id, shipping_date, carrier, tracking_number)
VALUES 
    (1001, 101, '2023-01-16', 'FedEx', 'FDX123456789'),
    (1002, 104, '2023-01-26', 'UPS', 'UPS987654321'),
    (1003, 105, '2023-02-02', 'USPS', 'USPS456789123');

-- Example 4: Multiple LEFT JOINs
-- Get customers, their orders, and shipping information
SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, s.carrier, s.tracking_number
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
LEFT JOIN shipping s ON o.order_id = s.order_id;

-- Example 5: Filtering with WHERE vs. ON clause
-- Method 1: Filter in WHERE clause (filters after join)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.city, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE c.city = 'New York';
-- Inefficient

-- Method 2: Filter in ON clause (maintains all left table rows)
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.city, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id AND c.city = 'New York';
-- We still got all customers with NULL values as it's Left Join

-- Method 3: Using subquery to filter left table first
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, c.city, o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount
FROM (SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York') c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
-- Most Efficient

-- Example 6: Advanced filtering with aggregation
-- Find customers who haven't ordered in the past 30 days
SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name, MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.customer_name
HAVING MAX(o.order_date) IS NULL OR MAX(o.order_date) < DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY);
```

### UNION and UNION ALL

- Used to combine the results of two different SELECT queries vertically (stacking rows).

- UNION: Combines result sets and removes duplicates.

- UNION ALL: Combines result sets and keeps duplicates. It is faster because it skips the duplicate-check process.

- Requirement: Both queries must have the same number of columns with compatible data types.
- UNION allows us to combine result sets from multiple SELECT queries into a single result set.
- Key points:
    - Combines rows from multiple queries into a single result set.
    - Appends rows vertically (stacks them on top of each other).
    - Requires that all queries have the same number of columns.
    - Column data types must be compatible across all queries.
    - Eliminates duplicate rows by default (use UNION ALL to keep duplicates).
    - Uses the column names from the first SELECT statement for the final result set.
    - Ignores column names from subsequent queries.
- Database Setup:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE union_demo;
USE union_demo;

### Full Join in MySQL

- MySQL does not have a native FULL JOIN command.

- Workaround: Combine a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN using the UNION operator to simulate a full outer join.
- FULL JOIN:
    - It returns all matching rows from both tables where the join condition is met.
    - It also returns all non-matching rows from the left table (with NULL values for columns from the right table).
    - It also returns all non-matching rows from the right table (with NULL values for columns from the left table).
    - It combines the results of both LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN, including all records from both tables and matching records from both sides where available.
- Join Types Comparison:
    - INNER JOIN (only returns matching rows between tables)
    - LEFT JOIN (returns all rows from left table and matching from right)
    - RIGHT JOIN (returns all rows from right table and matching from left)
    - FULL JOIN (returns all rows from both tables)

-- Additional examples - Employee/Department context
-- ====================================================================
-- For a typical HR database scenario, we would use:

-- Create Employee/Department tables
CREATE TABLE departments (

    department_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(100)
);
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,

    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    hire_date DATE
);

-- FULL JOIN example for employee/department context
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_id, d.department_name, d.location
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
UNION
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_id, d.department_name, d.location

### Cross Join: Cartesian Product

- A cross join pairs every row from the first table with every row from the second table.

- Math: If Table A has 5 rows and Table B has 4, the result is 20 rows (5 X 4).

- Practical Example: Combining a "Products" table with a "Colors" table to see every product in every available color.

- Warning: Be carefull on large production tables! Joining two tables with 1,000 rows each results in 1,000,000 rows, which can tank performance.

- Database Setup:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE cross_join;
USE cross_join;

-- Create Table Products
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

-- Create Table Colors
CREATE TABLE colors (
    color_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    color_name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name) VALUES
(1, 'T-shirt'),
(2, 'Jeans'),
(3, 'Sweater'),
(4, 'Jacket');
INSERT INTO colors (color_id, color_name) VALUES
(1, 'Red'),
(2, 'Blue'),
(3, 'Green'),
(4, 'Black'),
(5, 'White');

-- Cross Join
SELECT p.product_name, c.color_name
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN colors c;

-- Create Table Sizes
CREATE TABLE sizes (
    size_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    size_name VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO sizes (size_id, size_name) VALUES
(1, 'S'),
(2, 'M'),
(3, 'L'),
(4, 'XL');

-- 5 * 4 * 4 = 80
-- Generate all possible product variations
SELECT p.product_name, c.color_name, s.size_name, CONCAT(p.product_name, ' - ', c.color_name, ' - Size ', s.size_name) AS full_product_description
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN colors c
CROSS JOIN sizes s
WHERE p.product_name = 'T-shirt';
```


### Self Join: Internal Relationships

- A Self Join is used when a table has a relationship within itself. You must use Aliases to distinguish the two "versions" of the same table.

- Scenario: An Employees table where one column is manager_id, which refers back to an employee_id in the same table.

- Syntax Tip: SELECT * FROM Employees e1 JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id; .

- Logic Check: Used to find pairs, such as "Employees working in the same department" or "Employees earning more than their managers".

- Create and use database:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE self_join_tutorial;
USE self_join_tutorial;

-- Create employees table with manager_id referencing the same table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    job_title VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    manager_id INT,
    hire_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample employee data with hierarchical management structure
INSERT INTO employees VALUES
(1, 'James', 'Smith', 'CEO', 150000.00, 'Executive', NULL, '2010-01-15'),
(2, 'Sarah', 'Johnson', 'CTO', 140000.00, 'Technology', 1, '2011-03-10'),
(3, 'Michael', 'Williams', 'CFO', 140000.00, 'Finance', 1, '2012-07-22'),
(4, 'Jessica', 'Brown', 'HR Director', 110000.00, 'Human Resources', 1, '2013-05-18'),
(5, 'David', 'Miller', 'Senior Developer', 95000.00, 'Technology', 2, '2014-11-05'),
(6, 'Emily', 'Davis', 'Developer', 80000.00, 'Technology', 5, '2016-08-12'),
(7, 'Robert', 'Wilson', 'Junior Developer', 65000.00, 'Technology', 5, '2019-02-28'),
(8, 'Jennifer', 'Taylor', 'Accountant', 75000.00, 'Finance', 3, '2015-09-17'),
(9, 'Thomas', 'Anderson', 'Accountant', 72000.00, 'Finance', 3, '2017-06-24'),
(10, 'Lisa', 'Martinez', 'HR Specialist', 68000.00, 'Human Resources', 4, '2018-04-30');

-- EXAMPLE 1: Basic Self JOIN to show employees with their managers
-- This joins the employees table with itself to match employees with manager information
SELECT * FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr
ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id;

-- EXAMPLE 2: Self JOIN with LEFT JOIN to include all employees (including CEO with no manager)
-- This ensures even employees without managers (like the CEO) are included in results
SELECT * FROM employees emp
LEFT JOIN employees mgr
ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id;

-- EXAMPLE 3: Group employees by department
-- Not a self join, but useful for context
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, GROUP_CONCAT(CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) ORDER BY employee_id SEPARATOR ', ') AS employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;

-- EXAMPLE 4: Find employees who work in the same department
-- Self join to match employees with their colleagues in the same department
-- The condition e1.employee_id < e2.employee_id prevents duplicates and self-matches
SELECT * FROM employees e1
JOIN employees e2
ON e1.department = e2.department AND e1.employee_id < e2.employee_id;

-- EXAMPLE 5: Find employees who make less than their managers
-- Self join to compare employee salaries with their manager's salary
SELECT * FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr
ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
WHERE emp.salary < mgr.salary;

-- EXAMPLE 6: Calculate average salary difference between employees and managers by department
-- This shows how to use aggregate functions with self joins
SELECT 
    emp.department,
    COUNT(emp.employee_id) AS num_employees,
    ROUND(AVG(mgr.salary), 2) AS avg_manager_salary,
    ROUND(AVG(emp.salary), 2) AS avg_employee_salary,
    ROUND(AVG(mgr.salary - emp.salary), 2) AS avg_salary_difference
FROM employees emp
JOIN employees mgr
ON emp.manager_id = mgr.employee_id
GROUP BY emp.department
ORDER BY avg_salary_difference DESC;

-- IMPORTANT NOTES FOR SELF JOINS:
-- 1. Always use different aliases for each instance of the table.
-- 2. When looking for pairs, use conditions like a.id < b.id to avoid matching rows with themselves.
-- 3. Self JOINs can be resource-intensive. Consider indexing columns used in JOIN conditions.
-- 4. Consider LEFT JOINs when you need to include records without matches (like employees with no manager).
```


## 3. Performance Tips

- Indexing: Ensure join columns (Foreign Keys) are indexed to speed up lookups.

- Selectivity: Avoid SELECT *. Only request the specific columns you need.

- Limits: Use LIMIT when testing queries on large production databases to avoid system hangs.

- Explain Command: Use EXPLAIN before your query to see how MySQL intends to execute the join.
