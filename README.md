# MySQL Complete Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly, step-by-step set of notes to help you learn MySQL and core database concepts in a practical and structured way.

## Why this repo exists

I created this repository to:
- Learn MySQL in a structured way
- Build strong database fundamentals
- Document everything I learn (like a personal knowledge base)
- Help others who are starting with SQL

## What You Will Learn

- Database fundamentals and the relational model
- SQL basics and command categories (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
- MySQL installation and setup on Windows
- Essential database terminologies
- MySQL data types: Numeric, String, Date & Time, and Binary
- Database-level SQL commands (CREATE, SHOW, USE, SELECT DATABASE, DROP)
- Table-level SQL commands (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, ALTER, DROP)
- SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, aggregate functions, subqueries, and UNION
- WHERE clause filtering with logical operators, NULL handling, LIKE patterns, ranges, lists, and subqueries
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions in queries
- Comparison operators (=, !=, <>, <, >, <=, >=) with numeric, date, and string filtering
- ORDER BY sorting with ASC/DESC, multi-column ordering, custom sorting, and performance tips
- Writing and understanding basic SQL queries
- LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination, efficient data retrieval, and performance best practices
- Aliases for columns, tables, expressions, and subqueries to improve readability
- Using DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate rows and return unique values
- SQL functions: string, numeric, date/time, aggregate, and more with practical examples
- Advanced filtering with GROUP BY, HAVING, and conditional logic
- Primary keys, composite keys, clustered indexes, pages, and buffer pool internals
- Foreign keys, referential integrity, relationship types, and junction tables
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), anomalies, and practical trade-offs
- SQL JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL workaround, CROSS, SELF) and UNION operations
- Subqueries, correlated subqueries, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS, and subquery filtering patterns
- UPDATE statement basics, safe update mode, timestamp tracking, and update controls
- DELETE vs TRUNCATE, foreign key delete behaviors, and data removal best practices
- REPLACE statement behavior (insert-or-overwrite), conflict handling, and bulk replace with SELECT
