# MySQL Complete Guide

This repository is a beginner-friendly, step-by-step set of notes to help you learn MySQL and core database concepts in a practical and structured way.

## Why this repo exists

I created this repository to:
- Learn MySQL in a structured way
- Build strong database fundamentals
- Document everything I learn (like a personal knowledge base)
- Help others who are starting with SQL

## What You Will Learn

- Database fundamentals and the relational model
- SQL basics and command categories (DDL, DML, DCL, TCL)
- MySQL installation and setup on Windows
- Essential database terminologies
- MySQL data types: Numeric, String, Date & Time and Binary
- Database-level SQL commands (CREATE, SHOW, USE, SELECT DATABASE, DROP)
- Table-level SQL commands (CREATE TABLE, INSERT, ALTER, DROP)
- SELECT queries with WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT, DISTINCT, aggregate functions, subqueries and UNION
- WHERE clause filtering with logical operators, NULL handling, LIKE patterns, ranges, lists and subqueries
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions in queries
- Comparison operators (=, !=, <>, <, >, <=, >=) with numeric, date and string filtering
- ORDER BY sorting with ASC/DESC, multi-column ordering, custom sorting and performance tips
- Writing and understanding basic SQL queries
- LIMIT and OFFSET for pagination, efficient data retrieval and performance best practices
- Aliases for columns, tables, expressions and subqueries to improve readability
- Using DISTINCT to eliminate duplicate rows and return unique values
- SQL functions: string, numeric, date/time, aggregate and more with practical examples
- Advanced filtering with GROUP BY, HAVING and conditional logic
- Primary keys, composite keys, clustered indexes, pages and buffer pool internals
- Foreign keys, referential integrity, relationship types and junction tables
- Database normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF), anomalies and practical trade-offs
- SQL JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL workaround, CROSS, SELF) and UNION operations
- Subqueries, correlated subqueries, EXISTS, NOT EXISTS and subquery filtering patterns
- UPDATE statement basics, safe update mode, timestamp tracking and update controls
- DELETE vs TRUNCATE, foreign key delete behaviors and data removal best practices
- REPLACE statement behavior (insert-or-overwrite), conflict handling and bulk replace with SELECT
- SQL indexing end-to-end: index types, B+ Tree internals, cardinality, covering indexes, invisible indexes, partial indexing patterns and index hints
- SQL transactions and ACID properties: BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK, isolation levels, anomalies, read/write locks, deadlocks, gap/next-key locks, MVCC, undo/redo logs and transaction states
- SQL views in depth: CREATE VIEW, updatable vs non-updatable behavior, security benefits, CHECK OPTION and view maintenance
- Stored procedures and functions: CALL, CREATE PROCEDURE, CREATE FUNCTION, IN/OUT/INOUT parameters, use cases and examples
- Triggers for automation and data integrity: BEFORE/AFTER, INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, auditing, validation, inventory updates and real-world use cases
- SQL window functions for analytics: execution order, ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE, percentiles, PARTITION BY, running totals and filtering patterns
- SQL CTEs (Common Table Expressions): WITH clause, multi-step query design, recursive queries, hierarchy traversal and sequence generation
- SQL constraints for data integrity: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, PRIMARY KEY vs UNIQUE, foreign-key behavior, constraint naming, validation patterns and practical schema rules
- Real-world database design: ER diagrams, schema design workflow, surrogate vs natural keys, soft vs hard delete, audit columns, denormalization, naming conventions, e-commerce and hospital examples, many-to-many relationships and design checklists
